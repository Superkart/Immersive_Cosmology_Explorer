Immersive Cosmology Explorer

Immersive Cosmology Explorer is a Unity-based VR and desktop application for interactive visualization of large-scale cosmological particle simulation datasets. The project enables researchers and students to explore time-evolving 3D particle data using immersive VR interaction or traditional desktop controls.

The application supports loading multi-timestep CSV-based simulation outputs and renders them as point-cloud visualizations with scalar-based color mapping, filtering, and adjustable transparency. Users can explore spatial structure, animate temporal evolution, and interactively adjust visualization parameters in real time.

Key features include:

Custom shader-based point cloud rendering with scalar-driven color gradients

Time-series playback across simulation timesteps with manual and automated controls

Real-time interaction for point size, opacity, and scalar filtering

Session saving and loading to persist camera position and visualization state

Dual-mode support for desktop and VR using OpenXR and XR Interaction Toolkit

The repository includes:

Full source code for the Unity application

Technical documentation describing architecture, data flow, and interaction design

A recorded demo video showcasing dataset loading, VR interaction, and time-lapse playback

This project bridges scientific data visualization and immersive XR technology, making complex cosmological simulations more accessible and intuitive to explore.
